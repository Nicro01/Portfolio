The "Portfolio" project is my personal portfolio, featuring a console-like theme (similar to a terminal or cmd). By typing "help," you can view the available commands. Additionally, you can explore my repositories and find tutorials that will be added later.

## Available Commands

- `help`: Displays the available commands.
- `welcome`: Shows a welcome message.
- `user`: Presents information about the user.
- `tutorials`: Lists available tutorials.
- `projects`: Displays my projects.
